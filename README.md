### Hi there 👋
### My nick name is Deki. I attended a bootcamp at <a href="http://www.neuefische.de"> neuefische<a/> and now I am currently undergoing retraining as a specialist in application development in the IT sector at <a href= http://www.gfn.de>GFN <a/>. I live by the law of attraction and believe that through learning and ambition you can achieve everything.

### I am very interested in Crypto and the Blockchain $BTC $ETH $BSC

## I think that the blockchain will make everything easier in the future.
